There is a huge unstable slip to the right that needs to be climbed 150m above before a bypass drops to the grassy Lasiya Bhanjyang (3415m; Lassi or Lamite Bhanjyang). 200m on is a bhatti in which you may be able to sleep on benches around the walls if it is open; the proprietor is cheerful and friendly and the location beautiful but it closes when water runs out. Climb through silver pines up the hill behind the bhatti for distant blue hills through ancient pines plus a view of Mt Jannu (7711m, umbhakarna) to the northeast.

We then continue through Asia\u2019s biggest rhododendron forests. The journey to Ghorepani is more or less as long as the trek on the first day. it depends on how fast you can walk. However, contrary to the Ulleri trail, it's much steeper and basically no part of it is completely flat. On the second day of the extraordinarily beautiful trek to Poon Hill, we leave cozy village of Ulleri at sunrise and headed uphill towards another village - Ghorepani. Ghorepani is located at the elevation of 2850 meters and it differs from other towns with the distinctive blue roofs and houses. It is also a gateway to the most important point of the trek - Poon Hill (around 3200 meters above sea level) which offers a spectacular, 360 degree view of the Annapurna range in the Himalayas. Especially stunning in March/April when all the wild rhododendrons blossom and cover the mountainous valleys in bright red colors. You should reach Ghorepani and take some rest at the guest house there before another strenuous sunrise hike to Poon Hill will await you the next morning at dawn. You'll notice the difference in the climate as well as the flora around you as you climb higher. The forest will become denser and more humid, with beautiful flowers everywhere and you'll see more and more rhododendrons. The rhododendrons make the entire area a magical place. Sometimes it seems impossible that it's all wild - it resembles more of an exotic garden rather than an ordinary forest. The color of flowers is bright red - it makes you fell like you're in a fairy tale or in the Avatar film - you must experience it yourself to see how amazing it is.
